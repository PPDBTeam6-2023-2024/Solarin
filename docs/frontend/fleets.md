## Description
<br>![alt text](../images/fleets.png)
This time useRef is used to linearly interpolate the fleet's position as well as rotation when moving and also in order to track the spotLight's target (to make fleet more bright).
Furthermore it is possible to also view stats of fleets just like armies on planets.
