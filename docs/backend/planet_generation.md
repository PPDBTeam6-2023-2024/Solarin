# Planet generation

## Overview
How planets are generated

## Description
A planet region is defined by a point and a region type. The perimeter of the region is retrieved by applying the voronoi method.
Planets are generated by placing random points on a map. We will generate regions which are represented by a single point.
Using a point and voronoi, we can determine for each position the closest point (region), it belongs to.

Our planets also have a planet type, we first chose a random planet type, and after we chose random planet region types
that can exist on that planet.

- To generate a random planet call this function `generate_random_planet(session: AsyncSession, space_region_id: int)` it is inside src/app/routers/spawn/planet_generation.py. This method will generate a random planet_region. From this planet_region it will generate a 10 x 10 grid. In each grid a random point is picked and a random region type is selected. This region type corresponds to the previously retrieved planet type. This function will return the id of the generated planet.

## To Verify
- The space region id must exits.

## Additional Information
- This feature is fully tested using pytest.
