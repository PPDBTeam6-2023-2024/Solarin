## File directing
- The Frontend code is present in the `/frontend` Directory
- The Backend code is present in the `/backend` Directory
- The Technical Report code is present in the `/docs` Directory (spread over multiple files for readability)
  - Inside the docs, we have the following directories:
  -  `/frontend`: all documentation with regards to frontend
  -  `/backend`: all documentation with regards to backend
     - the file `/backend/backend_structure.md` gives more information about the file structure of the backend
  - `/game_mechanics`: all documentation about certain mechanics/formula/calculations that occur in our code
  - `/game_explanation`: Docs explaining very high level how our game works and making clear what the user can do while
    - the file `/game_explanation/general_explanation.md` I advised to look at for a very general game idea

## Running the code
- To run our code we require that the database tables has been set up. (see `/backend/README.md`)
- The backend README needs to be followed, to see if the right dependencies are present, etc. (see `/backend/README.md`)
- The frontend README needs to be followed, to be able to correctly setup the frontend (see `/frontend/README.md`)

## Additional Information
- Recommended to read the .md files with a file reader that supports `LaTex` (because it is uses in a couple of files)
