# Galaxy Viewer

## Overview
Shows a galaxy with 3D planets where you can rotate around but also click to select the planet and double click to go to planet view.

## Technologies used
- ReactJS
 - react-three-fiber (ThreeJS)
 - react-three-drei

## Description
ThreeJS is used to display the planets in 3D as well as stars and a central star in the middle.  This is done by loading a 3D sphere and a 2D image of the map for planets and the Star component from react-three-drei. 

Clicking on a planet will bring the view closer to this planet. It will also provide the information about this planet
and whether the user has armies or cities on this planet or not.
