# User experience

We allow users to grow their civilization by conquest and colonization. Cities can contain buildings that can be upgraded by the user for a certain price (in resources). The upgrades will improve certain things about the building or give access to new things (producing more, training new kinds of units, ...). The thrill of conquering the settlements of other players and the fear of losing your own will encourage players to check the game frequently.  The game mechanics with regards to battles are the following: Both armies and cities have battle values (attack, defense, ...) deciding how strong they are in battle. An army its battle values will depend on the troops inside its army. Each type of troop will influence these values differently. Players will be able to strategize about their army composition. Some troops will cause a larger increase in attack and others increase the army their speed and so on. Armies can attack cities and also other armies that are present on the same planet. Cities will also have battle values by building/upgrading towers and walls. Armies can also be stationed inside a city to help defend against invading armies.   

Currently we are considering the following values: 

Attack: This value will be used in a calculation to see who wins the battle 

Defense: This value will be used in a calculation to see who wins the battle 

City Attack: Attack value that will only have an impact when fighting for control of a city. 

City Defense: Defense value that will only have an impact when fighting for control of a city. 

Recovery: will influence the number of losses of an army after a battle. 

Speed: Will influence the average speed of an army. 

The idea about City Attack/Defense will be that they influence only a part of the defense used 

For example: for a city (70% City defense + 30% normal defense). 

 

To make sure a player has the capabilities to start the game without risking direct conflict with major players. A player will spawn on a planet that in the worst-case scenario is populated by some other starting users. This planet will be for a given time invisible on the Galaxy View map for other players. To stimulate players to travel and colonize other planets we divide our planets into regions. Certain resources cannot be obtained in a certain region and in many cases, not all the required regions will be present on one planet. This means that players need to move to other planets to gain all kinds of resources. We also encourage taking control of an entire region by giving bonuses to a region that is fully controlled.  

In our vision, each planet typically undergoes phases, where the phases can increase but also decrease. 

Phase 1:   

Starts when the first player spawns on the planet and ends when starting on the planet would be too difficult for newest players. In this phase the planet is invisible to players who have not started on the planet to ensure the game is balanced 

Phase 2:   

The PVP phase of the game where players on forced to either form alliances or fight to gather resources and expand. This is when the planet becomes visible to others and therefore possible to invade  

Phase 3:  

The phase where one player or alliance comes out victorious and controls the entire planet 

 

Other features like Generals, Trading, etc. will give players the opportunity to really try their strategic endeavors and differentiate themselves from other players. The opportunity to create your own direction and focus will make the game more interesting and will stimulate players to spend a lot of time thinking about their next moves. Giving players the opportunity to communicate and work together with other players will also make the user-experience more engaging.
