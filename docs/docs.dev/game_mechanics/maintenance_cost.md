# Maintenance Cost
Both Cities and armies will have maintenance cost.
The end user will never directly receive information about the maintenance cost,
but we will calculate the maintenance cost based on the buildings (and also increases when buildings are upgraded).

Each building will have the following base maintenance cost:
