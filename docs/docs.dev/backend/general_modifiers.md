# general modifiers
When we assign a general to an army, the army will receive certain bonuses.
This is done with modifiers. Each general has a base modifier and this is also influenced by the political direction of the user.

The formula used for determining these modifiers is: ```attack_modifier * (1+certain ideology)```
This modifier itself is a percentage that will be applied to the base army stats.

Generals can be assigned to an army. If a general is already assigned this one will be unassigned.
A user can choose generals among a lookup list. If the general is already part of an army of this user, it will be excluded
from this list.

Generals can also be unassigned directly from an army.
