Users will control a space civilization managing its cities and navigating its armies.   

Our Game universe is filled with planets, on a planet a user starts with a city. Buildings can be built inside a city. A building produces certain resources, trains units, etc. Planets are divided into multiple regions (DesertRegion, PlainsRegion, ...). Depending on the region the city is situated in, we will be able to produce certain resources. New cities can be created by users (within certain constraints).   

Using ‘Barrack’ buildings units can be trained. Units will be assigned to an army. These armies can be controlled by the user: moving the army or using the army to attack/defend a city. When attacking a city, it will take over control of this city (if it wins this attack).   

Moving armies to their required positions will take time depending on the distance. Armies can both travel on the planet itself and go to other planets. A general can also be assigned to an army to give it some modifiers (ex. +10% attack).   

Players will be able to join an Alliance with other players and communicate with them. An alliance will make sure that players don’t attack each other and might work together.  

Our project will consist of 2 map views:  

A view of the planet containing the regions, cities and armies that are on the given planet. This will influence certain travelling times but will also contain information about which users have cities in the same region.  

A galaxy-wide map containing all the planets present in the game. Armies can also be controlled on this map and can be sent to other planets. When the number of players increases, the number of planets will also grow. Planets far away will be more difficult to reach. In the future we might also add extra things to do in this view if the time allows it. 

 

In addition, we are also looking at some form of trading resources between players and making it possible to give a civilization some political aspect, like defining if your civilization is a democratic or dictatorship, etc. This choice will set some modifiers.
