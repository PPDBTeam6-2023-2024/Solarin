Our game I an IDLE strategy game. The user playing our game will control a space civilization of an alien race.
Cities will be founded, and armies will be raised. Users will be able to fight each other using these armies, and try to conquer 
each other their cities. Each city has buildings, that can produce resources, train troops, ...
Users start on a single planet, where they can grow their civilization. Later on, users will be able to travel to other distant planets.
The goal of our game is to grow your civilization as much as possible, by conquering and working together.
The other documentation files inside the `/general_explanation` will shed some more light about the most important
game features. 

## IDLE mechanics
Our IDLE components mainly consist of time delays, and duration.
- Buildings that produce a certain resource, have a production of X amount fo resources /hour (So the user needs to wait some time).
- Training Troops for your armies will take time.
- Moving Armies, will take a couple hours depending on the distance.
- Adding/upgrading buildings will need some time to do the construction.

## Strategy mechanics
Our game will have a great deal of strategy and conquest. 
A lot of tactical decisions will be made with regards to managing cities, waging war, and working together with 
fellow users. The amount of time a user spends growing a civilization will give the user an advantage, 
but strategy will make it possible to overcome the head start of other players. 
Players will of course be able to make an account and login after a while to see their IDLE progress.

We make the strategy aspect possible by letting the user make a lot of decisions that may or may not help the user.
Modifiers will be provided to make the decision taking more important (ex. based on the type of region  the production rate modifier might change).
