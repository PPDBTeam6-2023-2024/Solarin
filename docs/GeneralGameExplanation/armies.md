# Armies
Controlling armies is a vital part of our strategy game
<br>![alt text](../images/army_details.png)
When we select an army (assuming we select an army controlled by the user self)
We can click 2 buttons: 'Move To' and 'Details'.
The Move To can be selected, when we click after on a place on the map, our army will move to the
provided position (using IDLE long times, but does also update live). When we click details another window appears.
'Create City' makes it possible to create a new city on the position of the army. 
The stats visualize the stats of the army, which will be used to calculate battle outcomes.
We can also see which units are part of this army.
