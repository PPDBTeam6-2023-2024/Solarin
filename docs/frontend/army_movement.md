# Army Movement

## Overview
Moving armies from point a to point b by selecting armies and clicking on the spot to move.
## Technologies used
- ReactJS

## Description
State arrays are stored on the frontend to know which armies are currently selected under "Move To". Furthermore the armies can be seen moving smoothly after choosing their destination. This is done by having set up a code that runs every interval to actually move the army images dynamically.
